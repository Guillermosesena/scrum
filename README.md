## Introduction

Agile is a type of methodology that has the ability to create products and respond to changes, these changes may be that the product requirements were not well defined 
at first or not were properly understood, also changes that arise with new market needs. Agile is a set of frameworks and methodologies that mainly focus on people,
that can be workers as collaborators and the client.


Differences from traditional development with Agile

- Work groups. For very large groups it is very difficult to know what each one is doing even if they are all working on the same project. For Agile, work teams are small, they have a short time (called an iteration) in which there is a clear objective that must be met.
- The requirements. In traditional development the list of requirements are large, in Agile these lists are bounded into small lists of requirements, you can not know exactly the list of all the requirements, but you must know in detail the small list of the iteration.
- Generation of value. List of changes that can take you weeks to fulfill in a traditional way, the client may want something to change and this only
It is carried out until the change list is fulfilled, to take better advantage of the time in agile methods, advances are presented
in small periods so that customers can give feedback on the product, so that changes can be made
carry out in less time. 

#### Scrum
Scrum is a framework in which a team collaborates to achieve the same goal. This framework can address complex adaptive problems, where the product delivery has a maximum value using creativity. The essence of scrum is working in small teams that arehighly flexible and adaptative.
The pillars of Scrum are:
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

Scrum values are:

- Commitment, the work team is committed to completing the iteration objective
- Courage, no matter the task that is proposed, it will seek to complete with the objective of the iteration
- Focus, each of the members will be focused on fulfill the objective
- Openess, the availability to listen to the people involved
- Respect, respect the work of each of the members of the work team

In scrum there are three roles: product owner, scrum master and development team.


#### Product owner

- Clearly express the items on the product list
- Give priority to the items on the list
- Optimize the work of the development team

- Ensure that the development team knows the items in the product list

#### Scrum master

#### Development team

They are professionals who perform the necessary activities to generate the product, some of their characteristics are:
- Self-organized
- Multifunctional
- No subteams 

#### Sprint
It is the heart of scrum in which an increment of the product is generated (they are the iterations).
